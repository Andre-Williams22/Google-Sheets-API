# Google Sheets API Project Proposal 


This project will automatically grab customers data and sends an email or text to them thank messages for using the companies service. 
This script will make the job of fulfilling customer satisfaction easier. 


1. The project will use the Google Sheet API and the Twilio API. The Google Sheets API will grab the customer's data. The twilio API will send them the automated text message

2. Once the data is grabbed from Google then we will store the data into a json file.

3. We'll load all the names and phone numbers from the json file and send them the customized text message with their name to their phone number.

4. Both team and the customers are satisfied and can go along with their happy day.
